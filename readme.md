# Silhouette


## Descriptions
Silhouette project is simple project about microservices, the project implementing  about `golang`, `microserviecs`, `clean arch`, `grpc` and `kafka`. First what is microservice? microservices is not about number of service, different of programming languages that implement  on service, but microservices is software as a service. Silhoutte project is a simple microservices because the silhouette project contains several services like `user-service`, `profile-service` and `notification` service where each service be a software as a service that serve each others, lets say, user registrations `user-service` wil be save data for authentication and another data like `user_id, address, gender, phone_number, etc` will pass to `profile service` for handling to store to database and `notification-service` will sent email after receive data from `user-service`. Also contain `commons` folder as library that store/ contains config  and `protocs` that use for handling gRPC each service. Wow, what is gRPC? gRPC is a remote procedure call develop by goole for communications, means of communications is communication betwen client and server, so... if `user-service` need data from `profile-service` then `user-service` will be client and `profile-service` will be server. Kafka, kafka is a message broker, so lot of message broker, like rabbitMQ, goole pub sub and etc. When use message broker? if you ask when we to use message broker is depends on case what kind of application we want to develop, but for general when to use message broker is when you design the task just do task does not need know the task successfully or not [EX [registration]: Task â†’ Register new user where while user have adding new user will be receive an email confirmation  so the task will handle user-service for registration and sending email will be handle by notification-service] so process just need waiting until user successfully add to database, not need to wait until email have been sent to new user. Because nothing gets blocked in the client application or service until the service finishes its task.The actual event itself will actually live on the message broker, possibly on an exchange or a queue, and it will sit there waiting for a consumer to pick it up and process it.[Fire and Forget]  

### Case
In this project will handle how user register until the new user will received email  after registration, `user-service` will handle several function like add-user, update-user, delete-user, we can say CRUD[Create, Read, Update, and Delete] for user `profile-service` will have CRUD to, and `notification-service` will handle sending email, the notification will sent email when user do registration and user update the new password.

#### design
```
User.go
- ID          int64
- Email       string
- Password    string
- Role        string
- Name        string
- Profile     Profile

Profile.go
- ID          int64 
-	UserId      int64  
-	Address     string
-	WorkAt      string
-	PhoneNumber string
- Gender      string
```

each service in this project will implement the clean arch, we can see the picture bellow how the structure the clean arch
i find the in on `repository` my friend

Next the design of implementation of `simple microservices`, `clean acrhitecture`, `kafka`, `API` like `gRPC` and `REST`\
